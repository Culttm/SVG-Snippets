SVG-Snippets
============

Type the snippet shortcode and then press `Tab` to complete the snippet.

The snippets are listed below in alphabetical order. The `'$1'` indicates the position of the caret/s. Some snippets have been set up so that pressing Tab jumps the caret/s to the next predefined spot. It's a little hard to explain, but any snippet that has a `$1/$2/$3/etc. uses this technique.
